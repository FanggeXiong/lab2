# lab2

For this lab, I picked three areas in the United States: **Washington**, **Oregon**, and **Montana** to investigate. To find out what kinds of tweets these three areas post the most, I selected 2 different time period. One is on Thursday and the other one is on Friday. In this case, I wish I can find out if there are any differences in tweets during these two time periods.

The first map ![Map1](/img/screenshot_of_map-1.png) shows the tweets data on April 21st, 2022 early morning. As people can notice that more tweets are posted in Washington, especially Seattle area. Whereas other data are spread across the country. If we look at the word clouds, we can find that there are many positive words such as "up", "love", and "Best" posted on Thursday. Without directly looking at the posts, I can feel the positive attitude of Twitter users.![cloud1](/img/screenshot_of_wordcloud-1.png)

For the second map, as shown below, ![Map2](/img/screenshot_of_map-2.png), it does not change too much in the total amount and distribution. The majority of data are clustered in Washington and Oregon. I guess it is because Washington and Oregon, specifically Seattle and Portland have a larger population than other areas, which leads to the fact that more Twitter users would post in these areas. But what shows differently is the word cloud.![cloud2](/img/screenshot_of_wordcloud-2.png)

The most common word for 22nd's tweets is "Fri". It might because 22nd is Friday. At the same time, words like "Day", "Apr", "Thank" also are mentioned for a couple of times. In this case, we can assume that more users are excited about the date. 

In summary, both world clouds show positive trends on tweets because they all show appreciation for something/ someone. Meanwhile, the timing also impacts what people would like to post. Like on Friday, most people might cheer up for weekends. 

This exercise can be a great tool to analyze users' behaviors or general trend if we can study it for a larger scale. In the future, I can deep down the study by increase the data sample and concentrate on more specific areas.
